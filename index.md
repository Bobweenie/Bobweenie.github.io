This project allows players to play 3 card games of their chooise
* Apples or Orange
* Higher or lower
* Highest match

The code itself it pretty simple and uses inheritance for most of the card games
So I wouldnt have to make the same card game for every option
Makes the code nice and readable 

## C# and GUI

A simple console‐based quiz application that tests your knowledge of programming terminology. When run, it presents a series of multiple‐choice questions, reads your answer for each, provides immediate feedback (“Correct!” or the right answer), and displays your total score at the end. It uses a compact data structure to store questions, options, and correct answers, making it easy to add or modify questions.
