This project allows players to play 3 card games of their chooise
* Apples or Orange
* Higher or lower
* Highest match

The code itself it pretty simple and uses inheritance for most of the card games
So I wouldnt have to make the same card game for every option
Makes the code nice and readable 

## C# and GUI

This is my Xamel project where I created a TikTakToe game using GUI and Txt file to keep track of players score
